First pull request:
- Have looked into how things are tested in the tests directory
- Have looked into some of the utilities 
- Learned the high-level structure of keras

Second pull request:
- Have looked into the examples directory to get higher understanding of the typical system usage
- Have looked more deeply into keras, specifically the layers directory (neural networks)
- Learned how the training is down in keras (it is done in the engine)
- Still learning the system in detail before beginning unit testing!
